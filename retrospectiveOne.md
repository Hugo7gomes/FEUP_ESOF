## Iteration retrospective 
---
1. What went well? <br />
We accomplished the goals previously set and all agreed that the size of the iteration was appropriate.
<br /><br />
2. What should we do differently? <br />
We should have known that the google calendar was not the best tool for our app's goal and we should structure better the order of implementation in our app.
<br /><br />
3. What still puzzles us? <br />
In certain aspects, how should we interact with the calendar's package.
